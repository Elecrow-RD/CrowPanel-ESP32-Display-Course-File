After determining the version of the board, please use the corresponding code according to the version of the board, the code of 1.X is the same as that of 2.X, which can be replaced arbitrarily, but in version 3.0, the code of 5 inch and 7 inch board has added additional code to provide initialization timing for touch function. 

<mark><u>You need to copy the "PCA9557" folder in the "file" folder to the library directory of Arduino IDE.</u></mark>

**"Course file"--->"File"--->"PCA9557"**

This is the library used to initialize the screen for touch in version 3.X of the board.
